# Live Face Recognition using OpenCV and DeepFace

This Python project demonstrates real-time face recognition using OpenCV and DeepFace. It captures video from a webcam and compares each frame with a reference image to determine if there's a match. The project utilizes the opencv-python library for webcam integration and image processing, and the deepface library for face recognition capabilities.

Key features:

Live face recognition from webcam feed.
Comparison of each frame with a reference image for face matching.
Real-time display of match status (Match/No Match) on the video feed.
This project serves as a simple demonstration of integrating face recognition capabilities into Python applications using readily available libraries. It can be used as a foundation for building more sophisticated face recognition systems or as a learning resource for understanding the basics of face recognition algorithms.
